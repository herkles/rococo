# RoCoCo - A royal Court Expansion

RocoCo is a mod designed to add many new events for holding court in CK3. To help add variety and replayability to holding court. So that playing as a Catholic in Ireland will have different things then an ashari in Arabia and so on. 

If you find any bugs or issues do let me know and I will try to fix them to the best of my ability. If you have ideas or suggestions for improvement do let me know, as I welcome all feedback provided that it is constructive feedback.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is the WIP version that is constantly being updated!

2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod

NOTE: If you are re-installing a mod, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues.
