    rococo_christian.500.desc:0 "One of your more zealous vassals, [wants_simple_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] has come to your court wanting you to live a more ascetic and simple life. Where you and your court focus more on apostolic poverty like Jesus did. However not all vassals want to support such an ascetic lifestyle throughout your lands, in particular, [wants_art_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] is against the idea. They look to you to see how you shall act."

    rococo_christian.500.desc:0 "Two highly devoted priests in your realm have come before to settle a theological dispute that has emerged what to do about Holidays. [anti_holidays_priest.GetTitledFirstName] states that holidays like Christmas aren't in the holy Bible and should be banned to focus on the will of the Lord, while [pro.GetTitledFirstName] supports the holidays, that they are fun and important for the peasants to learn about Jesus. Both priests look to you to solve the deadlock. "
